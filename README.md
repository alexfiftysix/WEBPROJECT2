# WEBPROJECT2
### Overview
Bandz is a web information system made in a team for INFS3202 at UQ. The system is designed as a band-specific social media. Bands are able to add personal infomation, post events, and sell tickets. Other users can search for events by name, location and date and buy tickets to these events. A chat feature using web sockets was included to allow users to talk to each other.

### Technologies
- Angular2
- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Current stage
Deadline met. 

Website was hosted on AWS briefly in an EC2 instance and later removed to avoid incurring costs.

There are 
##### Areas to improve on:
- User login implemented, but any user can make an event for any band, which just don't make sense.
- Design. Design is inconsistent and could be improved - from a visual and UX viewpoint.


### Running
Get yourself node package manager, then get into the repo and run npm install. Will need to run npm install seperately for the front and back ends of the site.
